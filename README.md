# OpenGL_Spaceship
@author : GUIRONNET Yannis

School project made with OpenGL and OpenCV 

Little game with spaceship, asteroids, and spatial satellite generation with OpenGL in C++.
The aim is to reach the satellite without hitting asteroids.

The movement is managed by the players' hands, and thus the game needs access to the webcam, all done to OpenCV.
